# CHESS GAME

* Developed a chess game to represent the board in such a way that the players can make moves by typing the move in the console by checking the validity of the move and give the appropriate response on the command line. 

## Getting Started

* Chessboard will be initialized by running the python3.py, this will display the chessboard with all initial set up, and the game can be started by entering the source and destination coordinates.

## Pre-requisites  
* Python 3 

## Installing  

* git clone <'repo'> 
* cd chess_board
* python3 game.py
  
## Running the test  

* cd chess_board 
* python3 test.py
                     

## Assumptions 

* There is a board (NxN) which is represented by a cartesian coordinate system.
* Assuming two players which are playing in alternate chances.
* Player1 begins the game followed by Player2 
* The game is designed and played as per the standard rules of chess.

## How to use

* If player1 wants to move 'pawn' piece placed at (1,2) to (2,2) he just has to enter these coordinates in the console. This would mark   the first move of Player1. 
* Similarly, Player2 can begin his turn by moving any piece of his choice.
* You can exit the game from the console by entering input as [-1]
